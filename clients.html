<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>

Designed and developed the communications software
for SGI's online lottery systems.  One piece of this software runs
on the back office processing engine (Linux), a second
piece runs on Windows XP as a communications front end
processor (CFE), and a third piece runs on the lottery point of sale
terminals (Embedded XP). All code is written in C++ and C.  Each of several
CFE's communicate to all Point of Sale Terminals across various
communication protocols include TCP, UDP, X.25, and multidropped
serial lines. The CFE's communicate via TCP/IP
to the process running on the back office system, which in turn
talks to SGI's proprietary transaction processing engine.
The piece on the terminal consists of an application process, a support
DLL and a Vxd/WDM Device driver.  The CFE program includes a software
implementation of the DES
encryption algorithm. Ported the communications software to QNX
embedded systems environment.
<BR><BR>
Designed and developed a network monitor application,
written in Visual Basic 5, to provide graphical diagnostic information
to system operators via UDP/IP messages between management consoles
and the Communications Front End.

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2>
Technical project leader for developing a VAX/VMS operating system as part

Responsibilities included scheduling tasks, top level software design,
code reviews, writing code as required, and assisting staff in
debugging.  Staffing under my supervision ranged from 2 to 10 people.
The Pascal program was a packet switching network operations console,
